This is a public repo to download some of my DayZ automation scripts. These are developed for the community servers I play on. They may or may not work on different servers.

I will always try to convert any scripts into a standalone exe that you can launch by itself. If you do not see an .exe file then you may need to install additional software. If the files end in .ahk you will need to install AutoHotKey. If it ends with .py you will need to install Python.
